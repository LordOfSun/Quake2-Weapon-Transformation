Midterm Project README
==========

There have been several small details from the original proposal that have been changed or removed to better fit
the final project. However, most of the details remain the same. Here is the final list of all key components in my
modification:

WEAPON MODIFICATIONS:
Each player/client will start out with each weapon except the BFG10K. The ammunition recieved is limited, however.

1. Blaster - A very close quarters weapon designed to one hit kill, if not severely injure, the enemy player. 

2. Railgun - Deals 75% reduced damage to players, but can be used to wipe all of an opposing players powerups.

3. Chain Gun - Fires rockets at normal speed, but each rocket's damage is reduced by 50%.

4. Hyperblaster - Each bullet deals only 1 damage, but will steal equal damage as health from another player.

5. Rocket Launcher - Deals no damage to the user, but in turn, deals no damage to the opposing players. The purpose of
                     this weapon is to allow rocket jumping as a means of relocation around the map.
                     
6. Machine Gun - Is now a three bullet burst weapon.

7. Shotgun/Super Shotgun - Both weapons have been given a higher damage output, but risk jamming and not firing. If they
                           jam, the animation will play, but the bullets will not be fired. The super shotgun has a 
                           higher probability of jamming.
                           
(Note: Grenade Launcher and Grenades have been removed from the weapons mod list in order to allow the powerups to work 
  properly.)

Power-Up Modifications:
There are five different powerups that can be very useful in certain scenerios. None of the power-ups will stack!

1. damagex2 - Upon picking up a health pack, the damage that a player will both give and take will double damage.

2. damageDiv2 - Upon picking up any type of armor, the damage that a player will give and take will be halved.

3. executioner - Upon picking up an ammo pack, each kill that a player recieves for the rest of their life will double.

4. standoff - Upon picking up rockets, the next attack the player shoots and hits an enemy with will deplete all of
              their ammunition. (Both parties will have 0 ammunition).

5. megaBlast - MUTANT ONLY: Upon picking up a grenade, the next attack the player shoots and hits an enemy with will
               instantly kill them. 
               
Game Mode Type Modification:
The new gamemode that has been created is a variation of the mutant game type. Initially, every player in the game is
not a mutant, but after somebody has claimed first blood, they will become the mutant (indicated by a blue glow). From
that point, the only way to increase your score is to either kill the mutant or get kills as the mutant. A non mutant
killing a non mutant will not grant a score increase (unless there is no mutants currently). Mutants have access to 
a one hit kill powerup, which will help them fend of the onslaught of players trying to claim their life. The game is
still relative to deathmatch, except with this new rule implemented. 

In order to play this game fully, you will need at least three players. You can play with two, but you will only be
trading kills back and forth between the mutant and nonmutant. All of the weapons are initialized to keys 1-9.

Good luck and enjoy the game!
